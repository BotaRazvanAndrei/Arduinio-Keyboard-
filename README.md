# Arduinio-Keyboard-
This project is about using the Arduino Pro Micro board for a certain task, for example pressing a button to open notes where it will type "Merry Christmas".

Here is the chematic of the assembly:

Insted of using on arduino uno, we will use an arduino pro micro or any other arduino board that uses the 32U4 chip. (The pinout in the chematict shown above is the same that I used on my Arduino Pro Micro)

  For the resistors we will use 10k ohm resistors for the push buttons( the left one is for Mac, the middle one is for windows and the right one is the enter button).
  
  Here is my setup:
